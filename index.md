# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Harrison Thayer and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Engineering.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    I had a lot of fun doing lab 8, specifically part 1. In this lab, we
    made a command line mad lib. I enjoyed learning about vectors, and 
    how I could convert the command line arguments into a vector of 
    arguments. This knowledge was very helpful for the future assignments
    where I had to covert the command line arguments to a vector of 
    arguments to help myself with more complicated labs.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was very difficult for me. If I were to have to do this
    lab now with the knowledge and experience that I now have, I would
    have a much easier time doing it. This lab however was very fun
    because we got to practice patterns with loops. I enjoyed
    saving my code and the hoping that it would work only to be failed
    by my code every time. However, in the end I was able to complete
    this lab. This one was my favorite overall.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 part 2 was also very difficult for me. It was much harder
    than lab 6 part 1. This lab we had to combine functions, which
    was already a new concept to me so having to combine that with 
    the complicated logic of the blackjack game was a challange. 
    In the end I stuggled a low, but it was still a lot of fun, and 
    I learned a lot.
